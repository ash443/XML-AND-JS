1. For the DTD file of Assignment , i Started with the Assignment.xml file . i created the in line DTD by including the elements fron the xml schema, after that i added the attributes for the elements.
then copied the code to Xmlvatidation.com and checked for errors , after solving some errors, i took a screenshot of the validation message from the site.
